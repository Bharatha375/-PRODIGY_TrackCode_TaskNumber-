My forth task as intern in PRODIGY INFOTECH.

Task about: Simple keylogger

Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.

Features:

The program imports time details form the device and the details from the keyboard which key or letter is pressed by the user.

The program generates a text file in the same location where the code is saved. This text file contains the key log details in normal text format.

The program writes date and time with space then the key log pressed by the user.

The program updates the text file and key log details for every press of the key on the keyboard till the code is on the running state.
